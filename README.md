using the Euler forward and backward methods. Integrate from *t=0* up to *t=5 t_{hl}*, where *t_{hl}* is the time for which the analytic solution *y(t_{hl}) = 0.5*.

Plot both numerical solutions and the analytic solution in GNUplot. Note, that in order to plot the analytic solution you can give the analytic expression directly to GNUplot.

Vary your step-width *dt* and the constant lambda. What are your observations?
